The trace format consists of 6 columns with comma separated values (CSV)

1) Trace event source
   0: AXI Slot 0 - emulates ARM or host accesses
   1: AXI Slot 1 - emulates DRE or on-chip accesses
   S: Software (key in address field)
2) Event type
   R: Memory Read Address
   W: Memory Write Address
   DR: Only word in a read
   FR: First word of data in read burst
   MR: Middle word of data in a read burst
   LR: Last word of data in read burst
   DW: Only word in a write
   FW: First word of data in write burst
   MW: Middle word of data in a write burst
   LW: Last word of data in write burst
   B: Response from write
3) Address (or software key) in HEX with 0x prefix
4) Data in HEX with 0x prefix
5) Length in bytes
6) AXI bus ID
7) Time stamp count
   Each tick represents 3.3333 ns
   When scaled by a factor of 20, each tick represents 0.16666 ns

Note that the Address and Data fields are in HEX. The other numbers are in decimal.

DRE memory accesses have a "1" in the first column and ARM accesses
have a "0". Host or ARM accesses occur through an AXI interconnect
monitored by Slot 0. On-chip or near memory accesses occur through
a separate AXI interconnect monitored by Slot 1.

AWK can be used to separate the events into different files or remove
columns depending on the input requirement of downstream analysis tools.
